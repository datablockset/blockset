# Overflow

## Level 1

The longest one is `[0x00, 0x01, .., 0xFF, x]`, where `x` is any byte.

However it does not fit into the digest size of SHA-256, which is 256 bits or 32 bytes.

We need to select a sequence which is only 31 byte long.

`[a00, a01, .., a1D, x]`, where `x` is `a1D >= x`, and `a[i] < a[i+1]`.
